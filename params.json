It's something that I wanted to play with for some while. \r\n\r\nThis project is about the game that I will be developing.\r\n\r\nI am using Javascript, html5 and the the library [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).\r\n\r\nI am running this all on my Raspberry Pi with Node.js check out my post ([Random Weekend Project](http://scottduke.github.io/posts/2014/08/17/Random-Weekend-Project/)).\r\n\r\nI will be carrying on with this when ever I get a free moment.\r\n\r\nIdea of the game.\r\n\r\n2D survival shooter. No not survival against zombies but against \"humans\" with weapons.\r\nOther features that I hope to build in:\r\n\r\n* random generated map\r\n* harder enemies\r\n* cover\r\n* weapon drops\r\n* cover will be become weakened if it takes a lot of damage.\r\n* no health re-gen\r\n* maybe health drops.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
